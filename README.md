# NASB Performance Mod
This is a mod to improve performance in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl on PC.

## Current Features

- Disable specific objects in each stage.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Grab the latest release [from the release tab.](https://github.com/megalon/nick-performance-mod/releases/latest) Not on Thunderstore yet.

## â„¹ Usage

Currently, this mod loads JSON files from the folder `Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl\BepInEx\Performance Mod\Stages`

The mod includes a few files with the download. You can edit these files in a text editor to change which objects get disabled. You can even create your own file for any stage that doesn't have a config yet.

To find out the names of the objects in the scene, you can use the [Runtime Unity Editor](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/RuntimeUnityEditor).

Start a training match in the stage you want to adjust, then open the Runtime Unity Editor and follow the instructions below.

Currently, only objects that are parented to the stage object are supported. Their transform heiarchy starts with

`game instance(Clone)/stage_{whatever}/`

Restart the game to load the updated files.

## ðŸ”§ Developing

This project requires `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`

You can install it with `JsonDotNet` via [Slime Mod Manager.](https://github.com/legoandmars/SlimeModManager/releases)

### Setup

Clone the project, then create a file in the root of the project directory named:

`NickStageHazardRemover.csproj.user`

Here you need to set the `GameDir` property to match your install directory.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GameDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</GameDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Now when you build the mod, it should resolve your references automatically, and the build event will copy the plugin into your `BepInEx\plugins` folder!
